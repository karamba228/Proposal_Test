## Project Description
This project involves developing an Inventory Management System (IMS) designed for small businesses to streamline stock tracking and management. The system will allow users to add, update, and delete products, monitor stock levels in real-time, and generate low-stock alerts. Additionally, it will include reporting features to analyze sales trends and inventory turnover. The project will utilize a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) for storing product data, a front-end interface for user interaction, and a back-end API for processing operations. This test project aims to demonstrate system scalability, efficient data handling, and user-friendly UI/UX principles.

## Project Details & Specifications
1. Project Title: Inventory Management System for Small Businesses

2. Objective: To develop an efficient, user-friendly system for managing inventory, tracking stock levels, and generating reports to improve operational efficiency for small businesses.

3. Key Features:
- Product Management: Add, update, and delete product details such as name, SKU, price, and quantity.
- Real-Time Stock Tracking: Monitor inventory levels with automatic updates after sales or stock adjustments.
- Low-Stock Alerts: Generate alerts for items that fall below the defined threshold.
- Reporting: Create reports for inventory turnover, sales trends, and stock movement.
- Search and Filter: Implement search functionality to quickly locate products based on categories, SKUs, or names.

4. Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Developed using React.js or Vue.js for a responsive and dynamic UI.
- Backend: RESTful API using Node.js with Express or Django.
- Database: Relational database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store product and transaction data.
- Hosting: Deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
- Authentication: User login and role-based access control (Admin and Staff).


## Project Stages
### Phase 1
Requirement Gathering and System Design
In this phase, the project requirements will be collected through meetings with stakeholders, identifying core functionalities, and documenting user needs. The system architecture, database schema, and UI/UX wireframes will be designed to provide a solid blueprint for development.

### Phase 2
Development and Implementation
This phase involves coding the Inventory Management System. The backend API, database integration, and frontend interface will be developed. Features like product management, real-time stock tracking, and alerts will be implemented, ensuring each component integrates seamlessly for proper functionality.

### Phase 3
Testing and Quality Assurance
Comprehensive testing will be conducted to ensure the system works without errors. Unit testing, integration testing, and UI/UX testing will validate functionality, performance, and responsiveness. Issues will be resolved, and final refinements will be made to ensure project readiness.

### Phase 4
Deployment and Evaluation
The system will be deployed on a cloud platform, with access provided to users for real-world testing. User feedback will be gathered for any required improvements, and project performance will be evaluated to confirm it meets business requirements.
